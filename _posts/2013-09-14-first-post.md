title: My first post to my gh.page via jekyll blog
---

Just getting up to speed on how to use jekyll & gh.pages to be used as a blog and to highlight projects and code that either I am making and writing or to highlights other's works. Expect this post to be edited and "fixed" a few times as I get used to this new set up. Here are [two]({{ site.url }}/pjs-test/) [tests]({{ site.url }}/pjs-test2/) w/ embedding [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) projects into [gh.pages](http://pages.github.com), & a [test]({{ site.url }}/places/) of the new geoJSON embed feature on GitHub.
